# The algebra will have universe {0, 1, ..., 7}, and the following unary operations: 
f0 = 7,6,6,7,3,2,2,3
f1 = 0,1,1,0,4,5,5,4

# The above is nice and easy, but the following is more general
# and useful if you want to define many operations:
# Suppose all the operations are stored as a list of lists, as in:
fns = f0, f1, f2
# Build the list of operations by looping through fns:
ops = []
for i in range(len(fns)):
    ops.append(Operation(fns[i], "f"+str(i), 1, 8))

print "universe of an algebra of cardinality n with integers {0, 1, ..., n-1}, and in some cases"
